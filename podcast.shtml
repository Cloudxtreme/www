<p>free-as-in-node is podcast released every few weeks. While there are already tons of amazing tech podcasts out there, we're trying to create one which compliments freenode and other 
PDPC projects, ensuring that we keep the community at the centre of every episode. free-as-in-node takes a look at current happenings in the FOSS world, often cynical, sometimes serious and more 
often still, humorous.</p>

<p>We provide light banter, occasional information, a feel of community and at times coarse language. Each episode features a guest from a project using freenode as part of <i>Pimp My Project</i> -- 
alowing the projects to tell us exactly why they kick ass, while giving /you/ and us the chance to get to know them better!</p>
