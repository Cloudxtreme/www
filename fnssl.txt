Since the switch to ircd-seven, freenode now provides SSL client access on all
servers. If your client is not configured to verify SSL certificates, then you
can simply connect, with SSL enabled, on port 7000 or 7070.

If you wish to verify the server certificates on connection, some additional
work may be required. First, ensure that your system has an up-to-date set of
root CA certificates. On most linux distributions this will be in a package
named something like ca-certificates. Many systems install these by default, but
some (such as FreeBSD) do not. For most clients this should be sufficient.

Those of you using irssi will find that it has some oddities in SSL certificate
verification, and will not find the root certificates on its own. To work around
this, use <</connect -ssl_verify -ssl_capath /etc/ssl/certs chat.freenode.net
7000>>. Once you tell irssi where to find the root certificates, it should be
able to verify the certificate correctly.
