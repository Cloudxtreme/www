This directory contains a set of IRC client scripts designed to allow you
to turn off the [freenode-info] messages occasionally sent on channel join
on the freenode IRC network.

USE OF THESE SCRIPTS IS NOT RECOMMENDED, AND MAY RESULT IN
YOUR MISSING ESSENTIAL NOTIFICATIONS, IMPAIRING YOUR USE OF THE NETWORK.

The following scripts are provided for the most commonly-used freenode
clients:

    IRSSI      no_hints_irssi.pl
    MIRC       no_hints_mirc.mrc
    XCHAT      no_hints_xchat.pl

If your client is not listed above, be aware that you can turn off these
messages by inactivating server numeric 477.

AGAIN, USE OF THESE SCRIPTS IS NOT RECOMMENDED, AND MAY CAUSE YOU TO
HAVE PROBLEMS IN ACCESSING THE NETWORK.
