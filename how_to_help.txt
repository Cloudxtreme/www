to provide an interactive environment for coordination and support
of peer-directed projects, including those of free software and 
open source. Our network is currently implemented using Internet Relay
Chat (IRC). Our aim is to help improve the communicative and collaborative
skills of our participants and to
maintain a friendly, efficient environment for project
coordination and technical support.</font></p>

to Peer-Directed Projects Center, the not-for-profit entity which runs the
network.  Or you might want to
